📞 CUSTOMER SUPPORT DATA ANALYSIS & TICKET SYSTEM
🔍 Summer Internship Project – Analyzing customer support tickets to uncover common issues, sentiment trends, resolution patterns, and overall service efficiency using Python and Streamlit.

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer support ticket data to identify:

✅ Common customer issues and query types
😊 Sentiment trends in customer messages (positive, negative, neutral)
⏳ Average resolution times and pending cases
📊 Visualization of ticket distribution, issue types, and customer satisfaction

The dashboard was built as part of my Summer Internship to help companies improve their customer service by understanding patterns and bottlenecks in ticket resolution.
